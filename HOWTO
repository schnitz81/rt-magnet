In order for the rt-magnet GUI to work, there must be a config file with
the watch directories defined, /etc/rt-magnet.conf. This can be 
generated automatically by the install script. 

-  Put the install script in the same directory as your .rtorrent.rc 
   file (most commonly in your home folder) and run it as root:

       sudo ./install.sh

-  Put the two .php-files in a subfolder that will be webshared by your
   webserver software (defined as DocumentRoot by Apache config). For 
   example:

       /var/www/magnet/

   Also, make sure that your webserver is configured to use PHP.

Now, you should be able to reach the GUI with your browser. If you're 
running the webserver on the same machine, the adress should be i.e. 
http://127.0.0.1/magnet

If you add or remove watch directories to the rTorrent config, run the 
install script again and answer "yes" when it asks to overwrite the old
config.
