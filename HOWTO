In order for the RT-magnet GUI to work, there must be a config file with the watch directories defined, /etc/rt-magnet.conf. This can be generated automatically by the install script. 

- Put the install script in the same directory as your .rtorrent.rc file (most commonly in your home folder) and run it as root:

sudo ./install.sh

- Put the two .php-files in a subfolder that will be webshared by your webserver software (defined as DocumentRoot by Apache config). For example: /var/www/magnet/

Now, you should be able to reach the GUI with your browser. If you're running the webserver on the same machine, the adress should be i.e. http://127.0.0.1/magnet

If you add or remove watch directories to the rTorrent config, run the install script again and answer "yes" when it asks to overwrite the old config.
